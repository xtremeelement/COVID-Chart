# COVID-19 Data Tracker


Wanted to make an app that shows the data that I wanted to see about COVID-19.
Includes the New Cases, New Deaths, New Hospitalizations, Percentage Positive. It was hard to find these statistics on other apps
so I decided to make one.

Feel free to download and share!
